# Operating system development resources

This repository is intended to collect all kinds of information about operating system development. It is important that everything is included that a beginner needs to get started. Feel free to contribute.

The project targets the i686 architecture.

## Getting started
- Start by building your toolchain for the new target architecture. Have a look at the `README.md` file in the `toolchain` directory. There are scripts that automate the build process, but keep in mind, that you need to have the necessary tools installed. More information in the just mentioned `README.md`.
