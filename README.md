# Operating system development resources

This repository is intended to collect all kinds of information about operating system development. It is important that everything is included that a beginner needs to get started. Feel free to contribute.

The project targets the i686 architecture.

## Getting started
- Start by building your toolchain for the new target architecture. You can find instructions on how to accomplish that in the `README.md` file inside the `toolchain` directory.
